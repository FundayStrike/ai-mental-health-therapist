# About The Project
A small personal project that I made to test out the application of generative AI in web applications. The website functions as a mental health support chatbot, designed to help alleviate emotional distress by offering thoughtful and supportive responses. This project uses Gemini 2.5 Flash, using specially crafted system instructions to act appropriately in line with best practices used by mental health therapists. Responses are also contextualised using geolocation, crafting responses based on the user's country.

> Note: This is a small experimental side project, and not meant to act as a replacement for a human mental health therapist!

### Future Plans
- Beautify the webpage
- Add more context (e.g. age of user) for greater effectiveness
- Local storage of text history
